As a result, the system will become very helpful for conservation efforts as well as for the community. When the system identifies the presence of any wild animal, the information may be shared with forest officials as well as the general public so that appropriate safety measures can be taken. Wild elephants are responsible for the destruction of a significant quantity of crops and rice  fields  each  year  in  the  region  surrounding  the  KNP  as  well  as throughout  the  state  of  Assam.
